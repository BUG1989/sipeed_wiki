> Edit on 2022.03.23

## Summary

Lichee Tang Nano is a simple development board based on the GW1N-1 fpga chip which belongs to the Gowin little bee series. The development board is Small and delicate, and all resources of the chip are pulled out. There are Type-C interface, RGB Interface(this can be used to connect peripherals like LCD screen or VGB interface), PSRAM and Onboard USB-JTAG on this development board. All IO resources are pulled out, which is convenient for developers to use or extend. 
It's reallys suitable for about small digital logic designs or experiments .
