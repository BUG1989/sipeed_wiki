## Troubles with programmer

Make sure there are 2 converters in Device Manager before reading.

### Trouble downloading

**If you have any problems programming or flashing FPGA development board, it's suggested to use the programmer which can be downloaded at this page https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/TANG/programmer instead of what is installed with the IDE.**

### ID code mismatch

This error means wrong device choice. All that refers chip model(like he project device, pin constrain, IP modules and programmer device choose) need to be changed. 

### No Gowin devices found

This can be solved by replacing Programmer as mentioned in **Trouble downloading**

## Using GAO

It's tested IDE version before V1.9.8.1 and V1.9.8.1 is ok, the newer version is not ok.
